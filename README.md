# No-TikTok-Bot
Basic code for a Discord bot that filters messages
Currently simply deletes messages that match dictionary of words and replaces with pithy message.  Has also contained functionality for moving messages and responding with gifs at other times.
Keepawake file works by hosting server and then using uptimerobot.com to ping it and keep it active so that it can be hosted/stay active.
